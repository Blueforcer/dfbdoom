# Doom for Linux Frambuffer

This port of the original Doom source code targets Linux Framebuffer, without any intermediate abstraction layer (like SDL).

There is no keyboard input, sound or music - you can only watch the demo screen running in the framebuffer. Further, no scaling is implemented - resolution is the original Doom screen resolution.

This port depends only on *stdlib*.
